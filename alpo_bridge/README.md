# alpo_bridge #

## 1 Overview ##

The **Alpo Bridge** package provides a communication bridge between ROS1 and ROS2 to interface with **Alpo** robots, which run on a low-level ROS1 interface. This bridge allows the transmission of data from the robotâ€™s embedded joystick and controller (including wheel joint states and odometry information) and enables command transmission to the robot.

## 2 Bridge node description

### 2.1 ROS1 side ###

#### 2.1.1 Subscribed Topics ####

- **/alpo_driver/ackermann_controller/odom** (nav_msgs::Odometry)

  This topic is pusblished by alpo controller and provides a lot informations about robot kinematic and dead reckoning.

- **/alpo_driver/joint_states** (sensors_msgs::JointState)

  This topic is also published by alpo controller an provides informations about wheel joints states

- **/joy** (sensor_msgs::msg::Joy)

  This topic is published by the HJ60 joystick which is used to control implements and to switch between automatic and manual modes 

#### 2.1.2 Published Topics ####

- **/auto/cmd_steer** (ackermann_msgs::AckermannDrive)

  This topic is send to alpo controller and contains ackermann command provided by high level algorithms

### 2.2 ROS2 side ###

#### 2.2.1 Subscribed Topics

- **~vehicle_controller/cmd_steer** (ackermann_msgs::msg::AckermannDrive)

  This topic contains ackermann command send by high level algorithms to the robot  

#### 2.2.2 Published Topics ####

- **~vehicle_controller/odom** (nav_msgs::msg::Odometry)

  This topic is broadcasted by the bridge and provides odometry message computed by Alpo controller 

- **~vehicle_controller/joint_states** (sensor_msgs::msg::JointState)

  This topic is broadcasted by the bridge and provides joint states computed by Alpo controller 

- **~joy** (sensor_msgs::msg::Joy)

  This topic is broadcasted by the bridge and provides joy messages send by HJ60 embedded joystick 


## 3 Script ##

A script is provided to help to launch the bridge. This script automatically sources the ROS1 Noetic environment and launches the bridge node. You can run the script as follows:

    ros2 run alpo_bridge alpo_bridge_node
