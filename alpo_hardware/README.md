# alpo_hardware #

This package provides a hardware interface compatible with the ROS2 Control framework for both models of the Alpo robot. Once loaded by the Controller Manager, it allows low-level command execution on the robot and enables odometry feedback through the bridge (see the alpo_bridge package for more details).

For more information on how ROS2 Control works, please refer to the official ROS2 Control documentation.
